# Rabbitory CLI

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rabbitory_cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbitory_cli)

Rabbitory command-line interface (CLI) streamlines the deployment of the Rabbitory Control Panel infrastructure on AWS. You can effortlessly integrate with your AWS environment and automatically provision the resources needed to manage your RabbitMQ instances on the Cloud.

For information

## üõ† Features

### Seamless AWS Integration

By using your AWS CLI configuration, Rabbitory provisions the Control Panel infrastructure in your preferred AWS user account. Rabbitory CLI also allows you to choose your preferred region for deploying this infrastructure with 20 different regions to choose from.

### Deployment Automation

Rabbitory CLI handles the full deployment lifecycle of your Rabbitory infrastructure ‚Äî with zero manual setup. It creates the following resources for you:

- ‚úîÔ∏è IAM Roles
- ‚úîÔ∏è IAM Instance Profiles
- ‚úîÔ∏è Security Groups
- ‚úîÔ∏è EC2 (Rabbitory Control Panel)
- ‚úîÔ∏è DynamoDB Tables

All Rabbitory AWS resources follow the principle of least privilege, meaning they are granted the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks ‚Äî nothing more.

### Automated Rollback

If any step of the deployment process fails, Rabbitory CLI will automatically rollback all changes to leave your AWS environment clean and consistent.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing Rabbitory, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher. If you need to install Node.js, you can do so [here](https://nodejs.org/).

- **npm**: Node.js package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js.

- **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)**: This is essential for authenticating with your AWS account. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html). After installing AWS CLI, please proceed to configure your AWS.

### Installing Rabbitory CLI

Once your AWS credentials are set up, you can install the Rabbitory CLI by running the following command:

```
npm install rabbitory_cli -g
```

## üê∞ Usage

### Deploying Rabbitory

Deploying your self-hosted Rabbitory Control Panel is as easy as running the following command:

```
rabbitory deploy
```

After entering this command, you'll be prompted to enter your preferred AWS global region, then your preferred AWS region code.

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rabbitory/rabbitory_cli/main/assets/select-region-code.png" alt="select-region-code" width="40%" />
</p>

Now that a region has been selected, you'll be prompted to choose between deploying to the default public IP address provided by AWS or providing your own custom domain. See next section for more information on custom domain setup.

Upon deployment, Rabbitory spins up all the necessary AWS infrastructure for you to self-host your personal Rabbitory Control Panel, where you can create, configure, and manage your RabbitMQ instances. Once Rabbitory has been successfully deployed, you'll receive a link to your Control Panel.

</p>

#### Custom Domain Setup

Using a custom domain provides secure HTTPS access and a professional URL for your Control Panel. If you choose the default public IP option, the Control Panel will only be accessible via HTTP.

If you opt to use a custom domain, you‚Äôll be prompted to provide your domain name and email address. You‚Äôll then need to update your domain registrar's nameservers with the ones provided. After DNS propagation (which may take up to 30 minutes), the deployment will automatically:

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rabbitory/rabbitory_cli/main/assets/provide-custom-domain.png" alt="provide-custom-domain" width="60%" />
</p>

- Create Route 53 records for both your apex domain and www subdomain
- Set up SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt
- Configure Nginx with HTTPS

Your Rabbitory Control Panel will then be accessible via HTTPS at both your apex domain (<https://yourdomain.com>) and www subdomain (<https://www.yourdomain.com>).

### Tearing down Rabbitory

If you need to teardown your Rabbitory Control Panel and all of its associated RabbitMQ instances, you can run the following command:

```
rabbitory destroy
```

Tearing down Rabbitory involves selecting the global region and AWS region code where your Rabbitory Control Panel was initially deployed. Then, all AWS resources that were created will be automatically deleted for you, leaving you with a clean AWS environment.
